    "# About this project\n",
    "The original [dft-book](http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/dft-book/dft.html) was written for VASP. In this project, we are rewriting most of that book for use with Quantum Espresso and Google Colab. \n",
    "\n",
    "Google Colab is a free service similar to Jupyter notebooks. Zack Ulissi worked out how to install all the libraries needed to run Quantum Espresso in a Colab notebook. This is not a production DFT service. We donâ€™t know the limitations on how big or how many calculations you can run. The examples in the tutorials have worked for us. We hope they work for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "Please get in touch if you would like to make contributions, or even give some of the lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "March 22, 2020: Pretty soon we are planning to host some live webinars on running these. Stay tuned here or on Twitter for the announcements.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Topics\n",
